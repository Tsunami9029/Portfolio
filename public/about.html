  <h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />

<P>A swordsmith from Kuwana of the Ise Province, whose title was Uemon-no-jou during the Bunki Era of Japan. He is considered to be the founder of the swordsmith school famed for forging the sharpest swords of the Warring States period of Japan.</P>

<p>While some documents dating to the Edo period claim the Muramasa school lasted for three generations, from the Jouji Era (1362-1368) to the Ouei Era (1394-1428), the oldest sword confirmed to have come from the Muramasa school was made during the first year of the Bunki Era (1501). For this reason, in this game Muramasa of the Bunki Era will be treated as the founding generation.</p>

<p>He appears in the "Seven Duels of Swordmasters" as a Heroic Spirit sent by the Counter Force, and he appears as a Heroic Spirit summoned by the Foreign God in this world that was wiped clean. What truths does this man hide? What are his motivations?
</p>

<p>"Huh? There's nothin' mysterious about me! All I care about is doin' my job right!"</p>
