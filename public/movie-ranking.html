<h3>Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou Season 3</h3>
<P>Seventeen-year-old Hajime Nagumo is your average, everyday otaku. 
    However, his simple life of pulling all-nighters and sleeping in 
    school is suddenly turned upside down when he, along with the rest 
    of his class, is summoned to a fantasy world! They're treated like heroes 
    and tasked with the duty of saving the human race from utter extinction. 
    But what should have been any otaku's wet dream quickly turns into Hajime's nightmare. 
    While the rest of his class are blessed with godlike powers, Hajime's job, Synergist, 
    only has a single transmutation skill. Ridiculed and bullied by his classmates for being weak, 
    he soon finds himself in despair. 
    Will he be able to survive in this dangerous world of monsters and demons with only a glorified blacksmith's level of strength?

<h3>Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 3rd Season</h3>
<p>When Subaru Natsuki leaves the convenience store, the last thing he expects is to be wrenched from his everyday life and dropped into a fantasy world. Things are not looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.

    However, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.</p>

<h3>Dandadan</h3>
<p>After being aggressively rejected, Momo Ayase finds herself sulking when she stumbles across a boy being bullied. Saved by her rash kindness, the alien-obsessed boy attempts to speak to her about extraterrestrial interests he believes they share. Rejecting his claims, Ayase proclaimed that she instead is a believer in ghosts, starting an argument between the two over which is real.</p>
    <p>In a bet to determine who is correct, the two decide to separately visit locations associated with both the extraterrestrial and the supernatural—Ayase visiting the former and the boy visiting the latter. When the two reach their respective places, it turns out that neither was wrong and that both aliens and ghosts do exist.</p>
<p>    This marks the beginning of Ayase and the boy's adventure, as they attempt to fix the surreal, supernatural, and extraterrestrial elements around them to return to a normal life.</P>
